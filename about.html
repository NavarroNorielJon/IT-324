    		<P>During 2016 
		 Mayor Mauricio Domogan created the Baguio City Human Rights Action Center (NHRAC) and the Baguio City Human Rights Action Team (BCHRAcT) to handle human rights concern 
		 and complaints on human rights violations. Its goal is to protect human rights principles and to enable the city government to mandate, respect and fulfill human rights with right jurisdiction.
		 </p>
		 <p>Fast In-Migration and out-migration in Barangay Palma-Urbano are active because most of the residences are students. Although the barangay is small, it is a go-to and most likely 
		 the best residence for students, tourist or families because the barangay has active businesses, 2 church, 2 schools, and a lot of transcient houses. Burnham Park and the market 
		 is near the barangay and is very accessible. The Barangay promotes Orders, Peace, and Cleanliness.
		 Barangay Palma-Urbano's mission is to inform and encourage the community to do their responsibilities as good citizens. In todays era almost all places in our country are being abused
		  of their rights, but if all of us do our part and do the right thing we will ultimately change and end abuses in our community. Change may be slow and doesn't come easily, but with all of 
		  our combined efforts, a little progress will be very impactful. We will someday succeed and will lead to positive change.

			<h2>Human Rights in Barangay Palma-Urbano</h2>
            <h2>The Right for a Clean Environment, Health and Sanitation </h2>
            <p>
            The United Nations had already recognized the human right to water and sanitation and acknowledged that clean drinking water and sanitation are essential to all of us. 
			The right to clean environment is the primary advocacy of barangay Palma-Urbano because they believe that clean environment will lead a happy and healthy life. A clean environment
			is a Civil rights that focuses in Environmental Health and Protection. In achieving
			the barangay's goal to have a clean environment, its people should also do their responsibility to help protect and mantain the cleanliness in the barangay. 
			Since the barangay is mostly compose of Transcient houses that are being occupied by students it is very relevant to educate and inform them the importance 
			of Health and Sanitation. The barangay is very strict when it comes to garbages, the people should recycle their garbage in the right trashcan whether it is biodegradable,
			HIT (hazardous,, infectious, toxic), E-waste and Residual.

			<p>One of Barangay Palma-Urbano's goal is to provide their community safe, accessible, and clean water and sanitation for all. Soma days the people of Baguio 
			encounter water crisis which affects some barangays in the city including Barangay Palma-Urbano. Unauthorized drilling of water on land all over the City is still 
			happening, overtime this will cause sinkhole that will be very dangerous to the people.
