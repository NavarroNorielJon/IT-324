<h2>Barangay Palma-Urbano</h2>
<p>Barangay Palma is a small barangay with four streets namely Labsan, Urbano, Queen of Peace, and Pinpin street. The barangay is accessible to the central city district. Travelling to the town or the city hall only takes a few minutes. This means that fast in and out migration occurs. Tourists from different parts of the nation or the world often come visit the barangay for a place to stay. Despite the influx of population in the barangay, the barangay officials make sure that the place is orderly. They achieve this through incorporating their "Zero Waste" advocacy. The "Zero Waste" program discourages the people of the community to add to the garbage of our city, rather encourage them to be innovative by being creative with salvageable items (i.e. Foil satchets)and practice proper segregation.</p>
