					<h2>Programs &amp; Organization</h2>
					<p>The barangay Palma- Urbano developed an organization, The BADAC (Barangay Anti-Drug Abuse Council). The incharge of BADAC is 
					Kagawad Ronaldo T. Lenon, which they proposed to help reduce and strengthen the prevention of drugs in order to instill discipline 
					among local residents in their barangay community especially the youth.</p>

					<h2>Barangay Palma-Urbano bans the sale of liquor and cigarettes</h2>
					<p>The barangay has an ordinance on prohibiting the sale of cigarettes or tobacco products and Alcohol/Liquor or 
					intoxicating drinks in their barangay. That is one thing that makes the barangay stand out from all the other
					barangays because they are the only barangay who have this ordinance in the whole Baguio.</p>
					
					<p>Violators of the developed program should be punished by a fine of P999.00 which will be paid directly to the barangay treasurer. 
					The cash that has been gathered will be added to the general assets of the barangay.</p>
					
					<p>We can also report violators through text, just text NOYOSI to 2256. P1.00 per text for smart,
					globe and sun subscribers or visit www.smokefree.doh.gov.ph</p>
				
					<h2>MASA MASID</h2>
					<p>MASA MASID is a Mamamayan Ayaw Sa Anumalya at Mamamayan Ayaw Sa Illegal na Droga. This program is a group of volunteers that consist of seven members.  
					These are the volunteers that composed of constituents who are concerned about graft and corruption, and drug users. 
					Their task is to observe the neighborhood for any suspicious activity.</p>
					
					<p>The barangay also have a box named "MASA MASID". Information like graft and corruption, possession of illegal drugs 
					or drug dealer and drug users can be submitted anonymously via "MASA MASID".</p>
					
					<p>Drug user captives were reported by residents of the barangay. According to Kagawad Ma. Buena Victoria T. Tenefrancia,
					information about this is very confidential but it is said to be that those who are captured are under the rehabilitation process to recover from being a drug
					addict.</p>
					
					<h3>Did you know that Alcohol/Liquor and Cigarettes are considered drugs?</h3>
					<p>Alcohol/Liquor and Cigarette is hardly ever considered to be a drug and often referred to as the riskiest drug,  This may be because of its lawful status,
					normal use, or belief that its consequences aren't extreme. Alcohol or Liquor is a depressant drug and Cigarette has a nicotine that absolutely addictive.</p>
					
					<p>They do affect the function of the body, This implies liquor and cigarette moderates the capacity of the central nervous system when it enters the body. 
					Individuals may see that cigarettes or liquor help them to feel calmer or less worried or less stressed. That's why people's perceptions, emotions, 
					movements, vision, and hearing can be changed when they drink or smoke.</p>
