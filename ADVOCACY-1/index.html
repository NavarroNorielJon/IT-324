        <h3>The Barangay</h3>
			<p>Barangay Palma-Urbano is an orderly, peaceful, and clean Barangay. The barangay connects to 5 roads, 
			and is "very accessible" in regards to its location, thus also making the area a "fast in and out" barangay. 
			Because of their accessibility, the barangay also includes 3 banks, 220 transient houses, and have had a 
			total of 127 business establishments in the area in regards to a previous year update. Due to the 
			accessibility and transient houses, Palma-Urbano is known to have "dancing numbers", although that does 
			not affect the permanent residence in the barangay, since its residents are quite familiar with each 
			other within their neighboring areas.
