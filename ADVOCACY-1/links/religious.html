		<h3>What is Religious Tolerance?</h3>
			<p>
			In one society, many religions and cultures live and stay what they are. Beliefs that are much different
			from another. As it grows, some of them criticize and disrespect one another, resulting to conflicts and 
			the endless noise every group has to argue about. In religious tolerance, everybody practices respect and
			civility. Every group must have the freedom to believe what they believe and respect what others believe.
			Making a more peaceful community and each groups equal rights.
			</P>

		<h3>Religious Tolerance in Palma-Urbano</h3>
			<p>
			There are different religions in the barangay. Mostly are Catholic. The 2 most known church in the barangay
			are for Catholics . From issues and arguments in the barangay, there
			are no conflicts regarding differences in religions. Moreover, the barangay has no problem maintaining the peacefulness of religions
			and how everybody respects each other within the community. One situation that shows religious tolerance is when there are events for all of the people in the barangay. The officials
			tend to be more sensitive to other religions. Having them something they could actually and rightfully eat and activities 
			which other non-Catholic people can participate.
			</P>

		<h3>The Barangay in ACTION!</h3>
			<p>
			What if an issue comes up.. what will the barangay do?
			The barangay has what they call "LUPON" which is the judiciary sytem of the barangay. It is composed of the Lupon pres.
			and the barangay captain. When there is a problem or issue in the barangay, it first goes through the Lupon, where the
			groups can talk it out and make up. This procedure of the Lupon reduces groups to demand each other and take it to the real
			court.
